IMAGE OPTIMIZATION (IMPORTANT!)
================================================================================

Before uploading, optimize all images:

OPTION 1: Online Tools
- TinyPNG.com (recommended, free)
- Squoosh.app (Google's tool)
- Compressor.io

OPTION 2: Desktop Software
- Adobe Photoshop (Export for Web)
- GIMP (Export As → adjust quality to 80-85%)
- ImageOptim (Mac)

RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:
- Format: JPG
- Quality: 80-85%
- Max width: 1920px for hero images, 1200px for others
- Remove metadata

This will reduce file sizes significantly and improve page load speed.

================================================================================
HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGES
================================================================================

METHOD 1: cPanel File Manager

1. Log into your hosting cPanel
2. Navigate to: File Manager
3. Go to: public_html/wp-content/themes/WohneGruen/assets/images/
4. Click "Upload"
5. Select all 32 images
6. Wait for upload to complete
7. Verify all files are there

METHOD 2: FTP Client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.)

1. Connect to your server via FTP
2. Navigate to: /public_html/wp-content/themes/WohneGruen/assets/images/
3. Drag and drop all 32 images from your computer
4. Wait for transfer to complete

METHOD 3: WordPress Media Library (NOT RECOMMENDED)

This method is NOT recommended because the images need to be in the specific
theme folder, not the WordPress Media Library.

================================================================================
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

After uploading, verify all images:

[ ] All 32 image files uploaded
[ ] Files named exactly as specified (case-sensitive!)
[ ] Files are in: wp-content/themes/WohneGruen/assets/images/
[ ] File permissions set to 644 (should be automatic)
[ ] Images optimized (file sizes reasonable)
[ ] Test by visiting the model pages and checking if images load

You can also check via FTP/cPanel to ensure all files are present.

================================================================================
FILE NAMING - CRITICAL!
================================================================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: File names are CASE-SENSITIVE and must match EXACTLY!

Correct: model-nature-hero.jpg
Wrong: Model-Nature-Hero.jpg
Wrong: model_nature_hero.jpg
Wrong: model-nature-hero.JPG

All file names use:
- Lowercase letters
- Hyphens (not underscores)
- .jpg extension (lowercase)

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING

Q: Images not showing on the website?
A:
1. Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Clear WordPress cache if using a caching plugin
4. Verify files are in correct directory
5. Check file permissions (should be 644)

will help users understand the differences. You can use the same image

- Hero images: 200-400 KB
